### Hello there, I'm Eren 👋

- 🏃‍♂️I'm running to improve myself in data science and machine learning
- ✍️ I use github to share the codes I learned from the lessons and also the projects I've applied.
- 📜 Also I share articles on Linkedin for people who decided to go the same route as me while I was developing myself, or just for people who are curious.
